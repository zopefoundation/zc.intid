"""
A set of subscribers for the object :mod:`zope.lifecycle` events.

There are two key differences from the subscribers that come with the
:mod:`zope.intid` package.

This does not register/unregister a :class:`zope.keyreference.IKeyReference`
with the intid utilities. Instead, it registers the actual object, and the
events that are broadcast are broadcast holding the actual object.

``IKeyReferenceces``, especially
:class:`~zope.keyreference.persistent.KeyReferenceToPersistent`, are
used for a few reasons. First, they provide a stable,
object-identity-based pointer to objects. To be identity based, this
pointer is independent of the equality and hashing algorithms of the
underlying object. Identity-based comparisons are necessary for the
classic :mod:`zope.intid` utility implementation which uses a second
``OIBTree`` to maintain the backreferece from object to assigned
intid (clearly you don't want two non-identical objects which happen
to compare equally *now* to get the same intid as that condition may
change). Likewise, these references are all defined to be mutually
comparable, no matter how they are implemented, a condition
necessary for them to all work together in a ``OIBTree``. Lastly,
these references are meant to be comparable during ZODB conflict
resolution (the original persistent objects probably won't be),
which, again, is a condition of the implementation using a
``OIBTree.``

A consequence of avoiding these references is that generally
persistent objects that are expected to have intids assigned *should
not* be used as keys in an ``OxBTree`` or stored in an ``OOSet.``
Instead, all such data structures *should* use the integer
variations (e.g., ``IISet``), with the intid as the key.

As a corollary to the previous point, this module *must* be used
with the intid utility from :mod:`zc.intid.utility`, (one
implementing :class:`zc.intid.interfaces.IIntIds`), which does not
depend on being able to use objects as keys in a BTree.

Therefore, this module looks for utilities registered for that
interface, not the :class:`zope.intid.interfaces.IIntIds`.

We do, however, keep a few things in common:

#. We do ensure that the object can be adapted to :class:`zope.keyreference.interface.IKeyReference`
    In the common case of persistent objects, this will ensure that the
    object is in the database and has a jar and oid, common needs.
#. We do broadcast the events from :mod:`zope.intid.interfaces`, even though
    the :mod:`zc.intid` package will broadcast its own events.
    There seems to be no reason not to and things like zope.catalog
    need them.

Configuring
===========

To configure, you need to include ``subscribers.zcml``:

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- configure.zcml -->
    <!--
    If we load zope.intid, we get subscribers for the Object events
    that ensure all ILocation objects are registered/unregistered when
    they are added/removed, plus another set of events when they
    get/lose intids. This second set of events is meant to update
    zope.catalog. A consequence of this is that ILocation objects must
    be adaptable to KeyReferences when they are ObjectAdded (for
    purposes of zope.intid, which we don't care about, but this also
    ensures that they have ZODB Connections, which is good).

    We cannot use these subscribers as-is due to the way the use IKeyReference
    and try to register that. However, our subscribers *do* make sure that
    the given objects can be adapted to IKeyReference because that's useful and
    may be required by catalogs or other subscribers.
