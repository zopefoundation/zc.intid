This package provides an API to create integer ids for any object.
Objects can later be looked up by their id as well. This is similar to
the ``zope.intid`` package, but it has the advantage of producing
fewer conflicts.

`Documentation`_, including installation and configuration
instructions and a detailed `changelog`_ is hosted at
http://zcintid.readthedocs.io.
